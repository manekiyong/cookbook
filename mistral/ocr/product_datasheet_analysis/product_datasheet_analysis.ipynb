    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrates automated product datasheet analysis using **Mistral AI's Document AI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case: Battery Procurement & Vendor Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "You're sourcing lithium-ion batteries for a portable device. Vendors send PDF datasheets with hundreds of specifications. Manually comparing each against your design requirements is time-consuming and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This cookbook automates the process:**\n",
    "1. **Extract structured data** from lithium battery PDF datasheets using Document AI - Mistral OCR with Document Annotations\n",
    "2. **Compare specifications** against design requirements\n",
    "3. **Generate detailed technical reports** with comprehensive analysis for each parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Files Required:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📄 Product Datasheet PDF** (`lithium_iron_cell_datasheet.pdf`)\n",
    "   - Vendor-provided specification document containing technical specs, safety info, and performance data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **📋 Design Requirements** (`battery_requirements.txt`)  \n",
    "   - Your project's specification criteria defining acceptable ranges for capacity, voltage, temperature, safety, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technology Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Mistral OCR** (`mistral-ocr-latest`) - PDF parsing with document annotations\n",
    "- ✅ **Mistral Medium** (`mistral-medium-latest`) - Technical report generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document AI for OCR + structured extraction\n",
    "- Direct Pydantic schema extraction\n",
    "- Comprehensive battery specification coverage\n",
    "- Safety-focused validation\n",
    "- Professional technical report generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:** Fast, accurate, and generates professional documentation for procurement decisions."

    "## 5. Extract Structured Data with Document Annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **key feature** of this cookbook. We use Mistral OCR's `document_annotation_format` parameter to extract structured battery specifications directly from the PDF in a **single API call**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The PDF is encoded to base64\n",
    "2. Mistral OCR processes the document\n",
    "3. The `document_annotation_format` parameter tells the OCR to extract data matching our comprehensive battery schema\n",
    "4. We get back structured data including capacity, voltage, current, temperatures, dimensions, and safety specs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Single API call (no separate LLM call needed)\n",
    "- ✅ Direct schema extraction during OCR\n",
    "- ✅ More accurate (extraction happens with full document context)\n",
    "- ✅ Captures complex nested specifications\n",
    "- ✅ Safety-critical validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document annotations are limited to **8 pages**. For larger documents, split them into chunks."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Built:\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrated a **production-ready workflow** for analyzing lithium battery datasheets using pure Mistral AI capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Comprehensive Data Extraction** - Capacity, voltage, current, temperature, dimensions, safety specs\n",
    "2. ✅ **Safety-Focused Validation** - Protection features, certifications, operating limits\n",
    "3. ✅ **Automated Compliance** - Compare against industry standards and design requirements\n",
    "4. ✅ **Detailed Reporting** - Pass/fail analysis for each specification category\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document AI** for extraction (no separate OCR/ LLM processing needed)\n",
    "- **Comprehensive schema** covering all critical battery specifications\n",
    "- **Safety-critical validation** for charge/discharge limits and temperature ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technology Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mistral OCR (`mistral-ocr-latest`) with document annotations\n",
    "- Mistral Large (`mistral-medium-latest`) for comparison reports\n",
    "- Pydantic for comprehensive schema validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is perfect for:\n",
    "- **Battery procurement** - Validate vendor specifications\n",
    "- **Quality control** - Ensure compliance with design requirements\n",
    "- **Safety validation** - Check protection features and operating limits\n",
    "- **Product development** - Compare multiple battery options\n",
    "- **Compliance reporting** - Generate validation records\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extending This Cookbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily adapt this workflow for:\n",
    "- Other electronic components (capacitors, resistors, ICs)\n",
    "- Different battery chemistries (LiFePO4, NiMH, etc.)\n",
    "- Resumes matching with Job description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document annotations are limited to **8 pages**\n",
    "- For larger documents, split them into chunks and process separately"
